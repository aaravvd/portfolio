I often times end up with a really messy desktop :) 
So I made a desktop cleaner which uses shutil and os + while loop to be automated

Automated Desktop Cleaner:

Will be prompted with entering your username on your computer for your directories 
Will then be prompted with what folders you want to create if you want to make any more 
Will then be asked for subdirectories 
move_files_to_directories will then run in the background until the user stops the program, cleaning the desktop every 10s with your given conditions
