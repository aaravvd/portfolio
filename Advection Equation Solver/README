Deep learning/Physics-Informed Neural Network Project using tools such as Pytorch. This is a part of a research project I am working on, where we are trying to create even better alternatives to Deep learning to solve aerodynamic/fluid dynamic specific problems.


Key points:

-Created a deep neural network with 4 layers(input, 2 hidden, output), using PyTorch and numpy
-Used ReLu activation function
-Generated training data using Forward-Time-Backwards space CFD model
-Trained on rectangular box, the hardest initial condition to use due to steep edges(not differentiable at certain points)
-Recommend running on sinusoidal initial conditions like sine and cosine, or different kinds of boxes, as that will show the true extent the model can perform to
-Created Physics-Informed Loss function by computing the right side of the equation(gradients of both using torch.autograd)
-PINN was 33% more accurate than standard DNN
-PINN was 53% faster than traditional methods




Common Problem that we use computational fluid dynamics(CFD) to solve
Advection equation = an equation that represents an object moving in a fluid advected by some velocity
Represented as a partial differential equation ∂u/∂x + a*∂u/∂t = 0, where t is time and x is space
Computational Fluid Dynamics - Use forward time backward space method(check gradient at all points forward in time and backwards in space), which is very cost inefficient 

To Solve this, me, Akshay Lakkur, and Michael Xiong, advised by a PHD student at UC Santa Cruz, Christopher DeGrendele worked as a team to create a very novel solution to this kind of a problem.

Physics Informed Neural Networks(pinns): A typical Deep Neural Network that incorparates a physics loss function

Essentially, when a computer computes the left half of the equation, ∂u/∂x + a*∂u/∂t*(using torch.autograd), it is inaccurate, so it will never truly be 0. This is known as our physics loss.
We get physics loss by imposing some constraints on the problem(in this case, ∂u/∂x + a*∂u/∂t MUST be as close to 0 as possible, which is minimized during gradient descent).
This extra physics loss makes the PINN 33% more accurate than a standard deep neural network, and 53% faster than using the forward time, backwards space method(CFD). 

Really fun project learned a lot about both Machine Learning and fluid dynamics/math :)
