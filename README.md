here are some personal projects :)

I'm currently interning at a start-up and working on projects for it separately, which will not be shown here or on my profile for a while. My work for that revolves around data science and creating ML models such as forest regression models, neural networks, etc, as well as some full-stack work with helping out with the frontend and backend!
