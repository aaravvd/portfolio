README:

Creating a convolutional neural network using tools such as pytorch and resnets to upscale an image. 

This is a project created during a Hackathon, with the challenge of completing it in under 24 hours. Created with Kaiden Ashvini, Rishab Jain, and Rohit Pulle

Image-Clarification App using De-Convolutional Neural Networks:

Convolutional Neural Network: Big -> Small
De-Convoultional Neural Network: Small -> Big
Use resnets to construct scaled-up image to unblur it

1) Add image
2) Run trained model
3) Model will output unblurred image

**Warning**: Model was created in 24 hours so it is not super accurate and complications may rise. 

Here is the dataset we used to train this model: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atulanandjha/lfwpeople

One day, we accidentally left the garage open at night and my bike got stolen. Now we do have cameras in our garage, but the footage was blurry and we couldn't see the face of who did it. This inspired me during the hackathon to make an image-unblurring app so that if we ever run into this problem again, we're prepared.
