This is a project created during a Hackathon, with the challenge of completing it in under 24 hours. Created with Kaiden Ashvini, Rishab Jain, and Rohit Pulle

Image-Clarification App using De-Convolutional Neural Networks:

Convolutional Neural Network: Small -> Big
De-Convoultional Neural Network: Big -> Small
Smaller grids creates a more accurate, unblurred image, which is why that was our approach towards unblurring images.

1) Add image
2) Run trained model
3) Model will output unblurred image

**Warning**: Model was created in 24 hours so it is not super accurate and complications may rise. You may want to train it on your own dataset just to be perfectly safe!
