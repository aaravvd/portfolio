README:

Creating a convoultional neural networks using tools such as pytorch and resnets to upscale an image. 

This is a project created during a Hackathon, with the challenge of completing it in under 24 hours. Created with Kaiden Ashvini, Rishab Jain, and Rohit Pulle

Image-Clarification App using De-Convolutional Neural Networks:

Convolutional Neural Network: Big -> Small
De-Convoultional Neural Network: Small -> Big
Use resnets to construct scaled-up image to unblur it

1) Add image
2) Run trained model
3) Model will output unblurred image

**Warning**: Model was created in 24 hours so it is not super accurate and complications may rise. 

Here is the dataset we used to train this model: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atulanandjha/lfwpeople
